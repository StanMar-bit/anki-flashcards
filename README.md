## Contributing 
Feel free to make PR requests for new flashcards / improvements! 

I also recommend the following extensions if creating your own flashcard decks:
- [Image Occlusion Enhanced](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155) to create flashcards for the images, especially helpful for cognitive science images and tables related to brain regions.
- [Enhanced Cloze](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1990296174) for lists of things to remember.

Also if something is wrong or you have a suggestion feel free to create an issue.

### That's it, happy studying!
